I work at Humberside Fire and Rescue Service as a data scientist. I'm currently undertaking a few projects involving joining lots of data together in order to be used in machine learning models.
These include risk-based inspection allocation, predicting arson attacks, and fire fatality profiling. Much of the data I use is open source, however some data is available only through a license.
Therefore, any times when data isn't publically available I will mention this in any uploaded code.

I graduated in 2021 with a degree in maths, and I specialised in statistics and topology.
